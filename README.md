# Learning from Noisy Labels with Deep Neural Networks: A Survey
This is a repository to help all readers who are interested in handling noisy labels. We are planning to include all popularly used data (with data loader) and necessary implementations for evaluation. 

In addition, we will update this repository on a regular basis to maintain up-to-date.

## List of Papers with Categorization

All Papers are sorted chronologically according to **five categories** below, so that you can find related papers more quickly.

Robust Learning for Noisy Labels
|--- A. Robust Architecture
     |--- A.1. Noise Adaptation Layer: adding a noise adaptation layer at the top of an underlying DNN to learn label transition process
     |--- A.2. Dedicated Architecture: developing a dedicated architecture to reliably support more diverse types of label noises.
|--- B. Robust Regularization
     |--- B.1. Explicit Regularization: an explicit form that modifies the expected tarining loss, e.g., weight decay and dropout.
     |--- B.2. Implicit Regularization: an implicit form that gives the effect of stochasticity, e.g., data augmentation and mini-batch SGD.
|--- C. Robust Loss Function: designing a new loss function robust to label noise.
|--- D. Loss Adjsutment
     |--- D.1. Loss Correction: 
     |--- D.2. Loss Reweighting:
